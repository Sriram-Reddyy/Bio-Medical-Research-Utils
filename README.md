### 1. Self-Supervised Learning Tasks

In this section, you will find implementations and tools related to self-supervised learning tasks. These tasks are crucial for training robust models without the need for external labeled datasets. Examples of self-supervised tasks may include contrastive learning, pretext task training, etc. Feel free to explore and adapt these tasks for your specific needs.

### 2. Image Data Generator

Effective data generation is essential in training machine learning models. The Image Data Generator included in this repository is designed specifically for working with histopathologic images. It provides utilities to preprocess, augment, and batch images, enhancing the diversity and richness of your training dataset.
